# Directory Structure Generator

**Directory Structure Generator** is a Python-based GUI tool that lets users create a hierarchical view of directory structures. Users can visualize their folder and file organization, save the structure to a `.txt` file, or copy it to the clipboard. Designed with a user-friendly dark theme, it ensures an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Directory Selection**: Users can select a directory, and the tool recursively generates its file structure.
- **Exclusion Filters**: Skip directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, and `site-packages`.
- **Save and Copy Options**: Save the generated structure to a `.txt` file or copy it directly to the clipboard.
- **Dark Theme GUI**: A modern, eye-friendly dark mode interface for seamless usage.
- **Loading Animation**: Displays a loading spinner while generating the directory structure for larger directories.
